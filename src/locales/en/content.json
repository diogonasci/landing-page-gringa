        "question": "How do private classes work?",
        "answer": "Private classes can be conducted online or in-person, depending on your location. Scheduling is done through Aula 360 Team's WhatsApp or directly through the platform, where you can choose the time that best fits your routine. All content is personalized according to your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do thematic group classes work?",
        "answer": "Thematic group classes are conducted online and last two hours. They focus on targeted reviews for exams and tests, usually occurring on the eve or very close to the exam date. During the class, the teacher simulates the exam/test content and conducts specific preparation so that the student arrives more prepared and confident on exam day."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do custom group classes work?",
        "answer": "Custom group classes are suggested by students, who choose the desired topic and invite other participants. These classes are visible to other students in the same grade on the platform, allowing them to enroll as well. Once the minimum of 5 students is reached, the class is confirmed and scheduled. The student who created the class doesn't pay if the minimum number of participants is reached."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel a scheduled class or group class?",
        "answer": "Yes, cancellation can be made up to 24 hours before the scheduled time. Otherwise, a cancellation fee may apply. To cancel, contact support directly through the platform."
